# FAB Theme AdminLTE
Port of AdminLTE for Flask-AppBuilder.

Under heavy development, not safe for use (or testing)  

If you'd like to contribute, let me know @mariofix (in most social networks) or open up an issue.

This theme is heavily inspired by https://github.com/shijl0925/Flask-AdminLTE3


## Roadmap
### Stage 1
- Overwrite the appbuilder/template folder for use with AdminLTE
- Template options via config.py
- Distribute as a FAB Template app for testing purposes

### Stage 2
- Create fab_theme_adminlte plugin for PLUGIN_MANAGER
- Minimal Setup
- multiple options (login-v[1,2,3], color variations, etc)
